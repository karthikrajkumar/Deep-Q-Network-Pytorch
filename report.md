# Report

## Model Details
we have used Multi layer perceptron, input size is the environment input size and vice versa for the output. Please check the implementation of model in model.py
####    TODO
we need to check the performance of using convolutional neural network

## Results
Snipping tool has been used to clip from python notebook.

## Agent Details
we have tried with the plain vannila Deep Q Network.
####    TODO - Implement with
*    Double DQN
*    Dueling 
*    Prioritized Experience Replay
*    Noisy exploration
*    Distributional
